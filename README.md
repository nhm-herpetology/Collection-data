Amphibian and reptile specimens at the Natural History Museum, London

**1. Registration number - This is the museum identifier for each specimen** 
>The NHM uses a date-of-registry based system for tracking specimens. Originally this system inolved recording the year, month, day and specimen recorded. For example, the second specimen registered on 12 January 1882 would be '1882.1.12.2'. Around 1950 the herpetology section dropped the month and day conventions and began registering specimens on a yearly, continuous basis. For example, the 100th specimen registered in 1998 would be '1998.100' and the 50th registered specimen in 1999 would be '1999.50'. Since 2015 specimens have been registered by combining the year of registry with a continuous series of numbers. For example, if the last specimen registered in 2015 was '2015.345' then the first specimen registered in 2016 would be '2016.346'. Most type specimens registered before 1947 have two registration numbers. The first type specimen registration number is the initial registration number and the second registration number (usually starting with 1946 or 1947) was added following World War II when specimen were returned to London following a period of off-site storage.    

**2. Taxonomy (Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species)** 
>All specimen records include taxonomic designations. In general, we follow [Amphibian Species of the World](http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/) for amphibian taxonomy and [Reptile Database](http://www.reptile-database.org/) for reptile taxonomy. Type specimens that have been synonymised with other taxa are listed as in the original description.  

**3. Locality (Latitude, Longitude, Georeferencing information)**
>Recent collections typically arrive with precise geographical coordinates. Older collections have been geo-referenced using a standardised protocol. This protocol involves establishing error (in the form of exent in km and certainty category) along with descriptive notes on how the geo-referencing decisions were made.   

**4. Collector/donor**
>This field indicates the collector or donor of specimens.  

**5. Comments**
>Important information related to specimens is inlcuded in this field. This may be related to field observations, or additional environmental data collected with a specimen.  

**6. Type status**
>This field indicates whether a specimen is a type (Either 'Type' or 'Non-type'). 

**7. Genetic resources**
>Specimens in the herpetology collection have genetic resources associated with them. These resources are limited to archival DNAs for the vast majority of the collection. More recent collections have frozen resources that may include RNAs and/or cell cultures.
