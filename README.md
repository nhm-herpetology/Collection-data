Amphibian and reptile specimens at the Natural History Museum, London

**1. Registration number - This is the museum identifier for each specimen** 
>The NHM uses a date-of-registry based system for tracking specimens. Originally this system inolved recording the year, month, day and specimen recorded. For example, the second specimen registered on 12 January 1882 would be '1882.1.12.2'. Around 1950 the herpetology section dropped the month and day conventions and began registering specimens on a yearly, continuous basis. For example, the 100th specimen registered in 1998 would be '1998.100' and the 50th registered specimen in 1999 would be '1999.50'. Since 2015 specimens have been registered by combining the year of registry with a continuous series of numbers. For example, if the last specimen registered in 2015 was '2015.345' then the first specimen registered in 2016 would be '2016.346'.
